# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## To create a new project

```bash

export APP_NAME=FirstApp
npx create-expo-app -t with-router $APP_NAME
npx create-expo-app -template examples/with-router
cd $APP_NAME

```

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash

   npm install

   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash

    npx expo start
   
   ```
3. To run the app in the browser, use the QR code or the Expo Go app.
   To run the app in the emulator, use the QR code or the Expo Go app. ( Any ONE**)

   ```bash

   npx expo start --web
   npx expo start --web --host 192.168.1.10
   npm run web  
   npm run android
   npm run ios

   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
